about.header;About
about.content.one;"Muevo believes that everyone should be able to manage their money quickly, conveniently, and without restrictions. We are introducing our blockchain-powered, stablecoin-based smartphone wallet app. The future is here, right in the palm of your hand.<br />
<br />
Our wallet holds the Muevo Dollar or USDm. The Muevo dollar is pegged, 1:1, to the value of the U.S. dollar. It enables you to send, receive and pay for products and services quickly, with the same convenience as using dollars bills, but with the added features and security of a digital currency.<br />
<br />
Our mission is to provide a payment service that works just like a bank account, but without the wait in long queues, hard-to-replace plastic debit cards, or expensive cross-border wire-transfer charges, without intermediaries and in full ownership and custody of your funds.<br />
<br />
For your convenience, we offer value-added services like purchasing Muevo dollars with local currency, conversions, and deposits in your local bank account and payments for subscription services such as Amazon and Netflix. In short, Muevo combines the power of blockchain technology with the convenience and ease-of-use of traditional payment services."
;
muevodollar.header;Muevo Dollar
muevodollar.content.one;"The Muevo dollar, or USDm for short, is a unit of value that lives on the xDai chain of the Ethereum network. In other words, the Muevo dollar is a blockchain-based digital currency with no centralized control or ownership, which makes it extremely censorship-resistant.<br />
<br />
The Muevo dollar is designed to adhere to the value of the U.S. dollar – the world's leading reserve currency – and this value is 100% guaranteed, as every Muevo dollar is backed by Dai through smart contracts. Dai is one of the best-known and most transparent stable digital currencies. We chose Dai as our underlying asset to ensure that the value of a Muevo dollar will never be as volatile as that of Bitcoin, for example. <br />
<br />
Digital currencies exhibit similar properties to fiat currencies (U.S. dollars, Pound Sterling, Euros, etc) but do not have a physical form like banknotes. This allows for nearly instantaneous transactions between accounts at any time of the day, without the typical bank transfer delays or costs.<br />
<br />We have made the Muevo wallet super easy to use. All the technical complexities happen behind the scenes. We made sure all the basic functions of the wallet are as easy (if not easier!) to understand as simply using your bank’s mobile app. You can pay for goods and services at participating stores or suppliers, send Muevo dollars to other Muevo account holders, share payment links via social networks (to collect funds from friends for a cause, for example), convert your USDm to local currency at competitive rates, send payments to 3rd parties via Zelle, or simply store them safely in your account. Your money, your choice!"
